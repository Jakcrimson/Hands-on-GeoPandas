# Hands-on-GeoPandas

This repository was created in order for me to learn more about geopandas and as an introduction to geospatial data. 
The non-exercise notebooks are made from articles in Towards Data Science, the exercises notebooks are simply applying what has been done the non-exercise notebooks.

The dataset folder contains the eartquake dataset used in one of the exercise notebooks.

All the notebooks are fairly commented.

Thank you !
